NOTE: SerpaeOS source code is not up-to-date on GitHub. Please check out SourceForge (serpaeos.sourceforge.io) for more recent versions. 

SerpaeOS is an "educational" OS project. Disk images can be found in "./bin". You can run on QEmu/KVM by typing:
$ qemu-system-i386 -hda ./bin/SerpaeOS.img -hdb ./path/to/secondary/disk -soundhw pcspk 
or ...
$ kvm -hda ./bin/SerpaeOS.img -hdb ./path/to/secondary/disk -soundhw pcspk

It is important that -hda be ./bin/SerpaeOS.img because SerpaeOS only boots to the master disk (had)
The -soundhw part is optional.

To build SerpaeOS, simply enter:
$ ./build.sh

A GCC cross-compiler, NASM, and Linux shell (or WSL) are necessary for proper building.

To run on QEmu, type:
$ make run

To run on KVM (closer to real hardware execution), type:
$ make test

Steps to update SerpaeOS (NOTE: instructions may change slightly from one version to the next, so read this document each time you want to update):
        1. Copy serpaeos.ki to a location on a disk with the old version on SerpaeOS. Replace 0:/sys with ./dirsys/sys directory.
        2. Boot the old version of SerpaeOS
        3. *Immediately* run 'pr sosupdt 0:/path/to/serpaeos.ki'
        4. When the installation is complete, reboot to your new copy of SerpaeOS!
