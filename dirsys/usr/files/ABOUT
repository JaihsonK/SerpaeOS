SerpaeOS is a free, open source, hobbyist project written in C and x86 assembly
by Jaihson Kresak (serpaeos.devers@gmail.com). SerpaeOS is based on PeachOS 
[https://github.com/nibblebits/PeachOS]
This is a manual to features of the OS as well as software that came with this 
version of SerpaeOS.

1. The Directory Screen. The directory screen can be accessed at any time by 
pressing and releasing the super key (ie the Windows Logo Key). On it, you will
find the current kernel version that you are running and a list of current 
processes. 
The first process listed is the Shell session opened by the kernel upon 
startup. It can be accessed any time by pressing the <home> key. The other 
processes have assigned a unique process ID (integer between 1 and 12, 
inclusivly). If it becomes necessary to know a process ID, you can find it here
on the directoy screen. Processes can be accessed simply by pressing the 
function key coresponding to the process ID (process ID 5 coresponds to 
function key <f5>, ID 6 to <f6>, etc.). Processes listed on the directory 
screen with a asriks (*) refer to the current process (ie, the one you are on 
now). Processes listed with a plus sign (+) indicate that the process is 
sleeping. See #2

2. Processes. One may have at most 12 processes open at a time. Each may have a
limitless amount of threads (the more threads, the greater lag time). 
Processes that are 'privledged' have the authority to read/write directly to a 
disk's sectors, access system files, manage other processes, etc. 
Understandably, one must exersize caution when giving a process privledged 
execution. See #3,"pr".
One process may host another. When this happens, the hosting process is put to
sleep. A sleeping process is in a state of suspence, and no threads are being 
executed. Upon termination of the guest process (which is oblivious to being 
hosted), the hosting process will wake up and resume operations. The guest 
process will share the same virtual screen as the hosting process. See #3, "he"

3. Software and Commands. SerpaeOS comes with a primitive colection of tools 
and commands. The following disscusses each of these. A brief refresher can be 
found by entering [help] in a shell.
    sosupdt is the SerpaeOS updater. sosupdt requires privledged execution. It
    also requires a kernel image (serpaeos.ki can be retrieved by building the
    target version and then copying the ./bin/serpaeos.ki file onto the hard 
    disk running SerpaeOS). It can be executed by simply typing [pr sosupdt 
    x:/path/to/serpaeos.ki] into the shell, or alternativly entering [pr 
    sosupdt] and entering the path later. After successfully running sosupdt, 
    it is important to immediatly reboot SerpaeOS.

    view is a file viewing utility. Simply type [view ~/LICENSE] or [view 
    x:/usr/myfile] to read a file. If the file is longer than the screen, you 
    can press 'c' to continue with the next 'page' of the file.

    fapp is a file appending program. [fapp ~/sample.txt] is the command to 
    edit the desired file. Simply type the information you wish to append, 
    press ctrl + d, and it will be saved at the end of the file.

    fwrite is a file writing program. Use of fwrite is identical to that of 
    fapp, the difference being that the text overwrites that which is already 
    in the file.

    rm is a file removal program. Simply type rm, followed by a list of 
    undesired files (directories are unsupported).

    shell.elf is the SerpaeOS Shell.

    pr gives privledged execution to an application (see #2 for definition of 
    privledged execution). [pr myapp] will give 'myapp' privledged execution 
    powers. Note that pr is a program. If it is desired to have that the 
    current shell host pr (and pr hosts the target application, such as 
    'myapp'), thanit is necissary to write the command as [he pr myapp], as 
    opposed to [pr he myapp], which would attempt to execute a program called 
    'he', which doesn't exist.

    he specifies hosted execution. As illistrated above, it MUST be used before
    the program name. A hosted program shares virtual screens with the host. It
    also forces the host to sleep

    kill is a SerpaeOS Shell command. Supply kill with a process ID and that 
    process will immediatly be terminated (killed). Note that the Shell will 
    need privledged powers to kill.

    rc is a SerpaeOS Shell command used to find the return code of a terminated
    process. rc will require the process ID. A return code of 232582381 means 
    that this process was remotly terminated (such as with kill).

The following programs are part of the MinGS package:
    echo

4. Keyboard. The SerpaeOS keyboard driver supports PS/2 compatable keyboards.
On almost all QWERTY keyboards found in North America and Europe, what
you see on the keyboard is what you will get. Note however that the keyboard 
driver is targeted to QWERTY keyboards in North America. Thus, the occasional 
British QWERTY keyboard will produce unexpected results, peticularly on the 
numberpad. 
A few uses of keyboard shortcuts and commands can be found in the above 
information. The following is a brief recap:

    Ctrl + Q:    this instantly terminates the currnt process.
    Ctrl + D:    this sends EOF to the current process' keyboard buffer.
    F1 - F12:    switch to process 1 through 12 (if it exists). See #1.
    Home:        switch to the home Shell. See #1.
    Super Key (upon release):   display the Directory Screen. See #1.
    

5. A walkthrough. The best way to become familiar with a new operating system 
is through use (and, for programmers, by studying the source code, which is 
available online at [https://serpaeos.sourceforge.io]). This walkthrough (and 
really all of this manual) can serve as a guide to your use. 
Upon booting to SerpaeOS, the kernel and bootloaders will do initialization of
the keyboard, screen, disk(s), etc. This sould take about 5 seconds. Don't
worry if you see 'KEREL ERROR (non fatal)'; this usually occures during disk 
initialization
The kernel will automatically launch a privledged instance of the SerpaeOS 
Shell (accessable by pressing the <home> key. See #1).
From there, type the desired program name (see #3) along with any arguments, 
and the program will appear on a new virtual screen (unless it is hosted). 
Switching between vitual screens (as described in #1) is much like switching
between applications on an iOS or Android smartphone. Viewing the directory
screen is like viewing the list of applications on you smartphone, except 
opening the diectory screen is not necissary to switch processes (see #1).
New software can be found on the internet. Since SerpaeOS does not as yet 
support internet access, it is necissary to download the new software 
on another operating system, and then move the file to the appropriate location
on the hard disk with SerpaeOS.
To do an update, download the target version of SerpaeOS from 
[https://serpaeos.sourceforge.io]. On the disk with the old version of SerpaeOS
delete the 0:/sys directory. Then copy the ./dirsys/sys directory that is found 
on the download to the disk with SerpaeOS. Then copy the ./bin/serpaeos.ki file
to a location on the disk other than the root directory. Then you can boot
SerpaeOS and run the following command: [pr sosupdt].
(See #3). After you reboot your computer, SerpaeOS is good to go!
